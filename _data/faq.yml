questionAnswer:
  - q: Who's paying for CityCamp?
    a: >-
      <a href="https://opensavannah.org">OpenSavannah</a>, an all-volunteer civic organization dedicated to making
      local government work in the 21st century,  is hosting CityCamp as its
      seminal fall civic engagement event. While in-kind use of Savannah Civic
      Center and a small amount of grant money is being provided by the City of
      Savannah Government, CityCamp is entirely autonomous from the City itself,
      and seeks to establish itself as a neutral, safe-space for city and
      citizens to have productive dialogue focused on the future of Savannah.
  - q: Are there age requirements to participate?
    a: >-
      Absolutely not! All ages are invited to attend, especially adolescents!
      The only caveat, however, is that we will unfortunately not be able to
      provide childcare services on site, as it is a liability to do so on
      City-owned property.
  - q: Where can I get some?
    a: >-
      A broad cross-sector of Savannah's 2,468 full time employees will be represented at the event, with representatives from all City service departments on hand to answer questions and clarify any points of fact In addition, City Council, Mayor Eddie DeLoach, and the entire Budget Management Office will be present. That said, aside from Melissa Carter of the Office of Budget Management, who will deliver a morning talk on the budget, no city officials will be treated any differently than other attendees. At CityCamp, we acknowledge that we are all Savannah residents, and that we all have equal voices in determining our city's future.
