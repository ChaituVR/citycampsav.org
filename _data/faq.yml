questionAnswer:
  - q: Who's paying for CityCamp?
    a: >-
      <a href="https://opensavannah.org">OpenSavannah</a>, an all-volunteer
      civic organization dedicated to making local government work in the 21st
      century,  is hosting CityCamp as its seminal fall civic engagement event.
      While in-kind use of Savannah Civic Center and a small amount of grant
      money is being provided by the City of Savannah Government, CityCamp is
      entirely autonomous from the City itself, and seeks to establish itself as
      a neutral, safe-space for city and citizens to have productive dialogue
      focused on the future of Savannah.
  - q: Are there age requirements to participate?
    a: >-
      Absolutely not! All ages are invited to attend, especially adolescents!
      The only caveat, however, is that we will unfortunately not be able to
      provide childcare services on site, as it is a liability to do so on
      City-owned property.
  - q: Who'll be attending from The City of Savannah?
    a: >-
      A broad cross-sector of Savannah's 2,468 full time employees will be
      represented at the event, with representatives from all City service
      departments on hand to answer questions and clarify any points of fact In
      addition, City Council, Mayor Eddie DeLoach, and the entire Budget
      Management Office will be present. That said, aside from Melissa Carter of
      the Office of Budget Management, who will deliver a morning talk on the
      budget, no city officials will be treated any differently than other
      attendees. At CityCamp, we acknowledge that we are all Savannah residents,
      and that we all have equal voices in determining our city's future.
  - q: How do I sign up to be on the Steering Committee for CityCamp?
    a: >-
      To join the Steering Committee, <a
      href="https://citycampsav.org/join-committee">fill out the application
      form</a> no later than Oct. 9, 2018 at 5 p.m. EST.
  - q: >-
      What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the
      event?
    a: >-
      Parking will be available for all attendees commuting by car. If traveling
      via public transportation, you may catch either the purple (#14) line CAT
      bus or the red (#25) bus to drop you off at the Montgomery and MLK stop,
      right next to Savannah Civic Center. You may also catch the free Purple
      CAT Trolley from anywhere in the Landmark District.
  - q: Who sets the rules for CityCamp?
    a: >-
      Under the advisoryship of project lead Terri-Thornton Davis and Brigade
      Captain Carl V. Lewis, a steering committee composed of residents and
      public servants is currently being recruited to oversee the event and
      ensuing public feedback period is equitable, civil, productive dialogue.
      We aim to make CityCamp different from most public feedback type events.
      It won't be just another gripe fest with public servants and residents
      yelling at one another.
  - q: Who's faciliating CityCamp?
    a: >-
      Coco Papy, Community Director of The Creative Coast, will be serving as
      the chief moderator for the event. In addition to serving on
      OpenSavannah's advisory board, Papy has facilitated large-group meetings
      in a variety of capacities in her years as a community organizer and
      political activist, with an eye toward keeping discussion focused,
      productive and civil. In keeping with OpenSavannah's core values, Papy
      deploys a number of strategies to ensure that discusssion is equitable and
      representative of all concerns, and not just a podium for those who yell
      the loudest.
  - q: How is this any different from previous 'public forums' in Savannah?
    a: >-
      CityCamp is being organized by, for, and with everyday residents. It's not
      a top-down initiative or last-minute-announced forum held merely to
      satisfy state requirements for public participation in budget proposals.
      It's not just performative in nature. While we can't ensure that all
      budgeting priorities residents bring to the table will be included in the
      2019 budget, we will ensure that all voices get heard. In addition, we
      will post all results from in-person feedback, from the web app, and from
      text-message surveys online in an accessible format for residents and
      leaders alike to draw insights from.
  - q: >-
      How might my community organization, neighborhood association, or
      nonprofit volunteer to partner with OpenSavannah for this event?
    a: >-
      We need everyone at the table for CityCamp for it to be a success. If you
      represent a community organization, neighborhood association or any
      nonprofit group working in the City of Savannah, including clubs and
      faith-based institutions, we invite your organization to co-host CityCamp
      with us. By co-hosting, we'll include your logo or group name in the event
      guide, on the event website, and indicate your affiliation on all members'
      namebadges. In addition, we'll ask your input as we decide on the
      specifics in the days leading up to the event. In return, all we ask is
      that you participate and, if you like, offer up your hands and volunteer
      to help out in running CityCamp.
  - q: Is the venue ADA-accessible?
    a: 'Yes! Yes, it is.'
  - q: Will you have food available for those with special dietary needs?
    a: Yep. You bet.
