     We need to make it clear that this is a resident-driven process, not a 
     top-down one from the City.<em>This will be a learning experience for 
     me to hear real people talk about how they view the budget</em>. Weâ€™ve 
     never really, truly gotten that from people.

      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries.
