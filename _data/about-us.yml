        Government and community members never have a chance to talk, think and work together in a safe place––we’re either angry at a City Council meeting or frustrated at a regular City town hall meeting where we don’t all get to talk to each other. CityCamp is the one chance to talk and think through ideas as equals - city staff and community members all have great ideas and valid concerns, what happens when we all get together at CityCamp? Awesomeness. <p>Organized by and for resident volunteers of OpenSavannah working in collaboration with public servants, CityCamp aims to bring together civic leaders, concerned citizens, elected officials, journalists, nonprofits, business leaders, youth, everyday residents, and all of Savannah's collective action for a day of solutions-building to answer the underlying question:<em>'What do we want to create together for the future of our city?'<em></p><p>As an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> style event, participants – that means you! – set the agenda for the day through lightning talks, leading breakout sessions, and posing questions. We'll be using the annual budget as a focus point for the day's discussion.</p>
