Luckily, Melissa Carter, Director of City of Savannah's Budget Management Department, will host a "Budget 101" workshop distilling the allocation process for us in <a href="http://plainlanguage.gov">plain language./a>. You'll also have a chance to pose new ideas to the entirety of City Council and at least one representative from all of Savannah's various departments.<div id="container">

    The last part of the day, we'll conduct an interactive budget simulation, both collectively to spark discussion and individually using an app built by OpenSavannah volunteers. All responses will be counted and displayed live, and later reviewed by the City as part of its decision-making process for the 2019 budget.
