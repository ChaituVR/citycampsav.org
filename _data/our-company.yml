sectionHeading: Help plan CityCamp
desc: >-
  <p>CityCamp isn't a top-down event. It's meant to be an event co-created by
  and for residents. That means you get a say in <strong>every</strong> part of
  the planning and agenda.</p> 


  <h3> Inclusion is our ultimate success metric</h3>

  <p>or CityCampSavannah to reach its true full potential, it should be planned
  and executed with the entire community, especially with other nonprofit
  organizations, community organizations, and local businesses. As with all
  OpenSavannah events, we do not want to not default to “just another bunch of
  white guys”.  We therefore must place inclusion and diversity above all
  else.</p>


  <h3>A more representative democracy is a stronger democracy. </h3>

  <p>We can and must do better at engaging all Savannah residents –– especially
  underserved communities –– in the process of deliberative democracy on issues
  of civic importance. And that’s an issue of shared responsibility.</p>


  <h3>Public feedback is only valuable when there is an engaged and informed
  citizenry. </h3>

  <p>We can and must do better at engaging all Savannah residents –– especially
  underserved communities –– in the process of deliberative democracy on issues
  of civic importance. It’s easy to blame our elected officials when things go
  wrong. It’s easy to complain about local government on Facebook. It’s much
  harder to take ownership in our communities and to take meaningful action to
  changing the status quo.</p>

    text: >-
      A citizen-led steering committee will oversee the day's events and help
      foster civic dialogue. The Steering Committee oversees fairness in the
      event and the feedback process, and should consist of representatives from
      both the public and private sector. Anyone can serve on the steering
      committee, but we ask that if you do, that you are able to volunteer your
      time at minimum of one (1) pre-event meeting with fellow committee
      members. <strong><a href='https://airtable.com/shreulkLhhigSKpWB'>Apply to
