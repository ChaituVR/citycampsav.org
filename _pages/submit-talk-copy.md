<h3>Criteria for Breakout Session Talks</h3>

<p>Breakout sessions are intended for deep-dive talks into pressing issues or innovative ideas that may or may not be solved or show a return on investment in a single budget year, but that will strengthen the City over the long term. They're also meant to provide a smaller-group safe-space for civil discussion with dialogue from fellow residents.</p>
<p>Attendees may select one of three concurrent breakout sessions for each of the two (2) 50-minute breakout sessions in the day's schedule</p>

<p>All breakout sessions <em>must</em> adhere to the CityCamp <a href="https://www.notion.so/citycampsav/Full-Official-Rules-of-Engagement-33710a6c3b4e4eb3a2a866030c1cd73a">Rules of Engagement</a> and agree to abide by the OpenSavannah <a href="https://opensavannah.org/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> in order to be considered for acceptance.</p>
