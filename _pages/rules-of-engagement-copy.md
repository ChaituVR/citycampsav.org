If we want to have&nbsp;*productive* civic dialogue that yields solutions and opens people‚Äôs minds to new ways of thinking at citycampsavannah, it‚Äôs important that we first lay clear ground rules.&nbsp;

## Breakout sessions & lightning talks

##### What is a üìù ‚Äòbreakout session‚Äô?

*Breakout sessions are smaller-group sessions led by a resident or city employee on a topic they‚Äôd like to discuss with the community. They‚Äôre intended to give participants more focused time to discuss issues and opportunities of most interest to them; they also provide a safe space for constructive feedback from fellow participants. A moderator will attend each breakout session to take notes and, as necessary, enforce proper decorum.*

1. Submit your breakout talk idea using [the official submission form](/submit-talk/){: target="_blank"} no later than midnight Oct. 15, 2018.

2. If your topic adheres to the guidelines below, it will be posted for the public to vote on beginning Oct. 16, 2018 and lasting through 5 p.m. Oct. 19, 2018.

##### What is a lightning ‚ö°Ô∏è talk?

*A ‚Äò[lightning talk‚Äô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk){: target="_blank"} refers to a short, timed, off-the-cuff talk on the main stage in which the participant delivering the talk make a persuasive case in less than four (4) minutes, with two (2) additional minutes set aside for questions from the audience. Lightning talks may be suggested in advance on the ideas board, but must be officially submitted at CityCamp in the morning by posting the topic to the Lightning Talk Wall. Fellow participants will use dot-stickers to cast their votes for their preferred topics.*

### **Highly Encouraged Topics** üéâ

* A novel or innovative potential revenue stream or reallocation of existing revenue streams that falls within the powers of a majority vote by City Council to enact.

* Topics that address strategies for improving the efficiency or equity of municipal operations; i.e. [*modular procurement*](https://modularcontracting.18f.gov/), [*innovation teams*,](https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/) [*open data policies*](https://opendatapolicyhub.sunlightfoundation.com/), *public feedback strategies*,

* You may submit a topic that more broadly addresses what you feel the City of Savannah‚Äôs values should be in the coming year, three years, or five years, particularly as those values fit within the City of Savannah‚Äôs Savannah Forward Strategic Plan.

* Topics that aim to spark a discussion about how to bridge intercultural divides or tribalistic tendencies of the region; i.e. *‚ÄúHow might the City of Savannah and Chatham County better work together to maximize efficiency and interdependency, and how might we as residents make such cooperation happen?‚Äù* OR *‚ÄúHow might we create coalitions around shared issues of civic interest that transcend neighborhood boundaries?*‚Äù

* Topics that address a specific priority area of Savannah Forward Strategic Plan or OpenSavannah‚Äôs primary advocacy areas.

* Topics that advocate for a neighborhood project that would set the stage for broader community empowerment and engagement.

### **Allowed Topics** üÜó

* Topics that may require a future citywide referendum to make possible but that (a) have a logical and mathematically viable basis to discuss or (b) address system-wide logistical issues of duplicative service delivery or silos within city government that could be eliminated in the future to maximize efficiency.

* If you represent a nonprofit, you may submit a topic of relevance to your organization‚Äôs mission or vision as long as it can be tied back to benefiting the residents of the City of Savannah. **You should not, however, request specific budget line items for your organization at this time.**

* Topics concerning an existing area or potential new area of funding you believe should be made a priority or be removed as a top priority in the city‚Äôs 2019 municipal budget considerations ‚Äì so long as you are open to civil dialogue with residents who may disagree.

### **Not allowed! ‚ùå**

* Topics that advance the interests of a private, for-profit business and not the general civic good.

* Topics that focus solely on past squabbles and offer no solutions for how to prevent future similar disagreements.

* Topics that violate the OpenSavannah [Code of Conduct](https://opensavannah.org/code-of-conduct){: target="_blank"} or the OpenSavannah [Diversity Statement](https://opensavannah.org/diversity-statement){: target="_blank"}.

* Topics without a clear and direct action component or feasible step forward for Savannah‚Äôs residents and civil servants; (i.e. no topics should address issues outside the scope of municipal powers such as: *‚ÄúWhat should the Federal Government Should Do About Immigration?‚Äù*)

* Topics that only advance a single line of ideology and allow no room for discussion or dissent from residents of different backgrounds; you should frame session topics and formats with an open mind to contributions.

* Topics that aim solely to make ad hominem attacks on any person or persons, including civil servants, public figures.
