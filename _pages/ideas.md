<em>While citycamp lightning talks won't officially be pitched upon and voted on until the day of the event, participants –- or those who can't attend –– are encouraged to submit short 'pitches' for their community's budgeting priorities and areas of potential focus that would potentially make for a valuable lightning talk. Use the form below to submit your topic! Upvote topics you agree with. Comment on other proposals, too. Please note that submitting an idea or topic doesn't mean you neccessarily are volunteering to give a talk. That won't happen until everyone is in the same room! </em>
