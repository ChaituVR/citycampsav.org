## **Highly Encouraged Topics** üéâ

* A novel or innovative approach to city allocation of funds that provides an equal or higher level or quality of service delivery for the same or less cost.

* A novel or innovative potential revenue stream or reallocation of existing revenue streams that falls within the powers of a majority vote by City Council to enact.

* Topics that address strategies for improving the efficiency of municipal operations; i.e. *modular procurement*, *innovation teams*, *open data policies*, *public feedback strategies*,

* Topics that propose novel or innovative (ideally cost-saving) ways of enhancing quality of life for *all* Savannah residents, particularly residents most in need of assistance.

* Topics that apply the possibilities, principles, and practices of the digital era to deliver government services faster, better, or cheaper.

* You may submit a topic that more broadly addresses what you feel the City of Savannah‚Äôs values should be in the coming year, three years, or five years, particularly as those values fit within the City of Savannah‚Äôs Savannah Forward Strategic Plan.

* Topics that aim to spark a discussion about how to bridge intercultural divides or tribalistic tendencies of the region; i.e. *‚ÄúHow might the City of Savannah and Chatham County better work together to maximize efficiency and interdependency, and how might we as residents make such cooperation happen?‚Äù* OR *‚ÄúHow might we create coalitions around shared issues of civic interest that transcend neighborhood boundaries?*‚Äù

* Topics that address a specific priority area of Savannah Forward Strategic Plan or OpenSavannah‚Äôs primary advocacy areas.

* Topics that explore new or currently unexplored ways for residents and the city to work together (either through stronger civic participation or through more accessible governing practices); i.e., *‚ÄúHow might we better translate the City Budget into simpler language for ordinary people to understand?*

* Topics that advocate for a neighborhood project that would set the stage for broader community empowerment and engagement.

* Topics that address any of the following issue areas: mobility, safety and justice, municipal innovation, civic participation,

* Topics that address ways to empower residents to harness their unique gifts and talents to improve their communities from the inside out.

* Topics representing or from a middle- or high-school age student in Chatham County.

## **Allowed Topics** üÜó

* Topics that may require a future citywide referendum to make possible but that (a) have a logical and mathematically viable basis to discuss or (b) address system-wide logistical issues of duplicative service delivery or silos within city government that could be eliminated in the future to maximize efficiency.

* If you represent a nonprofit, you may submit a topic of relevance to your organization‚Äôs mission or vision as long as it can be tied back to benefiting the residents of the City of Savannah. You should not, however, request specific budget line items for your organization at this time.

* Topics concerning an existing area or potential new area of funding you believe should be made a priority or be removed as a top priority in the city‚Äôs 2019 municipal budget considerations ‚Äì so long as you are open to civil dialogue with residents who may disagree.

## **Not allowed! ‚ùå**

* Topics that advance the interests of a private, for-profit business and not the general civic good.

* Topics that focus solely on past squabbles and offer no solutions for how to prevent future similar disagreements.

* Topics that violate the OpenSavannah Code of Conduct or the OpenSavannah Diversity Statement.

* Topics without a clear and direct action component or feasible step forward for Savannah‚Äôs residents and civil servants; (i.e. no topics should address issues outside the scope of municipal powers such as: *‚ÄúWhat should the Federal Government Should Do About Immigration?‚Äù*)

* Topics that only advance a single line of ideology and allow no room for discussion or dissent from residents of different backgrounds; you should frame session topics and formats with an open mind to contributions.

* Topics with an overtly political motive or that endorse or persuade residents to vote for or against any one candidate or candidates in future elections;

* Topics that aim solely to make ad hominem attacks on any person or persons, including civil servants, public figures,
